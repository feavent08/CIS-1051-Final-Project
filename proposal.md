# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Rock, Paper, Scissors

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A game of rock, paper, scissors with an extra twist. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The program will ask the user to select either r for rock, p for paper, and s for scissors. The code will display the user's answer and give couple second countdown. The code will then generate a random outcome acting as the opponents answer. At the end, the code will display if you've won or not and diplay your winning and losing stats. The game will also include different options such as "worm" and "ant". In this case, woem beats ant but beat by rock and scissors. Ant would beat scissors and rock but beat by worm and paper. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will accomplish a functioning code that will mimic the syle of a rock paper scissors game. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I'll be able to accomplish the visual element of the game before the deadline. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope I'll be able to accomplish an updtaed or more advanced version of the code.. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I have to begin to plan out the game and figure out how I want everything to work out. I also need to figure a code that will run smoothly through the program and the user. I would also need feedback so I could find ways to improve my code.
